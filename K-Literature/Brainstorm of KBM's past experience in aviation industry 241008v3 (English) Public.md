## Pieface

I've been teased for having too long a resume, so hopefully it won't be back here.

After leaving my job, I had no motivation to revise my resume, because I felt that it's a piece of paper that getting blacker and blacker. I was even on the verge of making plans to move to Japan, but in the end I wrote the following with a half-hearted "pie will fall from the sky" mentality:  
>[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Mollysuh) (Chinese)。

Calmly floating on a sea of debris, I vaguely saw tortillas falling from the sky. So I regained my confidence, and wrote what I thought was a Brainstorm from scratch, as Alperen had asked for it. I want to try to make this document as rich as taco.

First of all, one of my core ideas is that I don't think small drones are a traditional product of the aviation industry.  
I have talked to civil aviation pilots and I found out many of the standard documents they mentioned are outside of my knowledge, which highlights the differences between industries.  
Drones are more like the result of the robotics, microelectronics and automation industries. Especially robots, their goal is to assist or replace humans to complete various tasks, and quickly complete the process of "from nothing to something".  

I guess I have a quite deep understanding of how human nature changes in this process. Some people choose to study more about the machines, some people choose to just use the machines, some people choose to become less than the machines.  

The machines will not improve themself, but the man who studies the machines will improve the machines and themself.

## Just ask the magical robot first

Brainstorm is not popular in the workplace in China, so I have no experience in this subject. To get started instantly and prevent my article from getting too mechanized, I asked ChatGPT directly:

[Source](https://poe.com/s/FI6CtweUdydSR7kKleoR)
>KBM：How should I brainstorm on my past experiences to integrate into new teams and projects?

>ChatGPT-4o：  
>...  
>1. Review and Summarize Past Experiences
>2. Identify Connections to the New Team or Project
>3. Highlight Transferable Skills
>4. Set Learning and Growth Goals
>5. Seek Feedback and Engage in Conversation
>6. Take Action and Participate  
>
>By systematically reviewing your past experiences, identifying connections to the new team or project, and highlighting your transferable skills, you can better integrate into your new role. The brainstorming process is not just about reflecting on the past; it's also about recognizing how you can contribute to the new environment. Throughout this process, maintaining an open mindset and a willingness to learn will be crucial to your success in the new team.

## Non-machine related Q&A

>Q：How did I get away from internet censorship?  
>
>A：My friends in Hong Kong provided me with various technologies with this in the early years. In early we use L2TP, OpenVPN, later switched to SS protocol. Now that I am continuing and have upgraded to the most advanced Vless, I set up server overseas for proxy.

>Q：How did I come into contact with cryptos?    
>
>A：In fact, as early as 2017, I was attracted by the gains of Bitcoin and Litecoin, and I had some mining attempts. Later, in 2019, I started mining some real Ethereum and finally made money to buy a new phone, but didn't do research about smart contracts.  

>Q：What subjects are my weaknesses?  
>
>A：I'm bad at integrated circuit boards, math, and programming, all of those were machine-related. I had successfully made a poor quality Android app to fake the health code during the epidemic and put it into use, but actually I didn't want to do that. And I use Arduino occasionally and have recently been trying to figure out how to make an electronic thermometer. So in this way, I still have a lot of potential to learn to make PCB.  

>Q：Why didn't I learn a computer language for text programming?  
>
>A：When I was in middle school, I thought that programming would be a very generalized skill in the future, so I chose to learn graphics processing and modeling. As a result, I was only willing to choose graphical programming languages ​​such as Labview, and I found that it's not very practical.


## Those are robots but it's still human work

It was my first formal contract work in 2016.

At that time, even DJI didn't have a completed enterprise solution chain (now almost no one remembers S900 and S1000), and we didn't have so much budget to buy equipment from general aviation equipment suppliers. So we decided to buy various consumer-grade equipment, and then disassembled them, tested them, sorted out the principles, made strange things, and installed them on drones. I even used electrical tape to cover the lights of the aircraft.

In less than a year, we've lost three drones and their accessories, two of which were due to unsafe piloting beyond visual range, and one of which was DJI's A2 flight control malfunctioning in the air. Even consumer-grade products at that time didn't have such a high failure rate.
We tried to convince the boss to use open source flight control because it's cheap, but he still stubbornly bought DJI's S1000 kit and said, "We don't have time to do innovate", so we had to have it.

In short, during that time, we at least had a reliable plan for carrying out tasks and organizing various data. We even made an aerial camera rig that could be controlled wirelessly and flew it twice on the EC-155. Although it was not carried out due to various management reasons, we were still very excited. In the end, this period of history ended due to the loose management of the department and poor treatment. At the same time, various minor failures and terrible service also made me and DJI have an indissoluble hatred. But at least this time I didn't leave crying like a child, I was glad for that.

Then in the summer of 2017, I had a very short job and started working around Ardupilot and MavLink devices.  

Because Ardupilot is safer than all kinds of DJI controllers, and there is academic support from Hong Kong, and there is a large lawn for test flights, so we went smoothly and felt relieved. The maintenance of drones and the purchase of various parts have become our daily routine, and manufacturing technologies such as carbon fiber processing and 3D printing have been integrated. Sometimes, we have to deal with all-English documents from the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, and even help investigate the causes of various drone failures (~~including hijacking and fire case~~).  

However, the real reason for the end of this history is still unclear to me. I think it was I didn't take my job seriously. But the boss's explanation was that I was doing a good job, but I needed to lay off employees because the project was cancelled. By the way, today in 2024, that lawn is gone and has become a construction site.  

## Trying to let machines give us more meaning

Between 2018 and 2021, I think this is really the most ups and downs period for this industry and country in 21s century.  
I remember very clearly that on Christmas Day 2017, I was new assigned to work on drones and geoprocessing in a large company. My supervisor engineer is a very active person who pursues innovation in traditional industries; and my master is very particular about quality, treatment, and efficiency (he disdained me at first but gradually became an inseparable combination ~~and saved the world~~). 

It just so happened that the department manager was also an engineer who makes drastic improvements to the production process, so we were able to get in touch with the most cutting-edge enterprise equipments at the time, such as LiDAR and VTOL.

> "If you still wanna stay, what else do you gonna do, Dong?"  
> "I want to learn... skills"

In addition to the basic scenes, my team was fortunate to go to various magical landforms for flight and experiments, such as quarries, coastlines, subway tunnels, particle accelerator construction sites, etc. And I used my early experience in aircraft maintenance and improvement to modify many of our existing closed-source flight equipment, such as installing some analog signal transmission equipment, recorders, power supplies, etc., to adapt to these interesting environments. We completed a huge number of flight missions, so I was also responsible for setting up the basic storage network to archive our results.

There are also many episodes in this history, such as participating in the citizen exhibition as a disaster prevention exhibitor, being photographed by Google satellite, and grabbing our fallen drone from a tree.

Once we even received a commission to perform aerial photography in Venezuela:  

>Client: I know there is a project in Venezuela, South America, but there are no direct flights.  
>Supervisor: It’s not easy to transport the equipment, right?  
>Me: It will be a bit troublesome in terms of time arrangement, but as long as the equipment and personnel are safe, it’s fine.  
>Client: It’s pretty good there, and people there are very focus about the presidential election, and Americans will go there for vacation.  
>Me: ~~WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT~~

In fact, the reason why we didn’t get the Venezuela was that our equipments couldn’t be transport to there.  

But bad things started to happen, and the COVID epidemic broke out.

My master and I decided to urgently carry out aerial surveys during the shutdown period of the epidemic (March 2020), providing basic terrain data for [Shenzhen’s first quarantine area](https://earth.google.com/web/@22.63837773,114.11963735,59.17059594a,395.59030587d,60.75292848y,0h,0t,0r). And at that time, there was no other similar team in the entire city that could keep running.

But the supervisor who pursued innovation later paid a heavy price for his innovating. I heard that he applied for a huge flight mission, but the data obtained could not be used, resulting in millions of losses (I alsp heard that there were curses louder than earthquakes coming from the office that time). In the end, I copied these data worth millions and saved them in my own vault as a kind of digital collection that can be reviewed.

Supervisor resigned, and my department lost a person who was good at business and ideas. Later monthes, affected by the economic downturn and lack of market, the remaining members gradually resigned, including my master.

Our department lost almost all business and began to work passively. In the end, I also gave up all research there and left at noon on July 1, 2021. The technical core of this department dissipated.

I still remember those important colleagues, those who made progress together. Although I have no way to repay them, I can only hope they are still living well now...

>"I feel that we're done a good task!"  
>"This is nothing. Shenzhen actually has **more powerful places**, which are number one every year and have the largest scale..."

## Fight for time and space for the machine

After resigning, One day I went to a local drone manufacturer for an interview with the idea of ​just having ​experience, and in the end, it was indeed not adopted, but the person in charge who received me mentioned a sentence:

>"What should I do if I recruit someone stronger after I recruit you?"

In fact, I also realized that in the past few years, my team and I had almost no chance to build a fully functional and unrestricted flying device from scratch, because of lack of time, lack of money, and even lack of internal approval procedures. After that day, I thought that I must build my own system, have my own research environment, and preferably have my own aircraft, so that I can become stronger.

I decided to create a dedicated database, calculated the appropriate fuselage specifications, and constantly compared prices on shopping websites to collect various documents. This process lasted for nearly a month, and the fuselage, avionics, propulsion units, welding tools, inspection tools, 3D printers, various wires and consumables were all stuffed into my room.

Almost all the work, such as measurement, modeling, printing, simulation assembly, and parameter initialization, was carried out simultaneously. It was a very stressful process to try to digest so many things at once, and my room was not enough at the time. The 3D printer was running almost all day, and many parts had to be placed on the bed to operate.

Later, while the heat gun was smoking in the room, I realized that I needed a larger place to continue.

In late September, a series of complicated human reasons led my family to move out of the home we had lived in for thirteen years, but the new space was nearly 10 times larger. After moving, in order to ensure my income, I had to continue looking for a job, and I also put the personal project I was working on at the time into my resume.

This was an exciting moving, and I thought it would be a turning point that would broaden my prospects.

But in fact, it was a huge risk.

## Machines are also victims of the evil of human nature

In the middle of the epidemic, the entire society gradually evolved from the initial rush into a vicious confront, and I was naturally involved. Things started in October 2021...

I don’t even want to bring it up again, but I’m someone who is loyal to archiving history, so documenting them, to me, is a positive action. Maybe five or even ten years from now, someone will accidentally read this article and say: "Wow, KBM has experienced such terrible people and things before! ~~No wonder this person is so scary~~".

Even though it's been a long time and I always had weak victories at the time, every time I mention these things I receive a huge amount of comfort:

| **From**| **Opinion**|
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| EHang's friends| This situation should be a problem for the entire industry|
| Colleagues at Chengdu Aero Engine Factory| The overall environment is not good, but we can't get used to being treated like this|

...

This job was my second to last job. The mistake I made was that I was in a hurry and trusted people with backgrounds in DJI. Although they seemed to having interest on my personal ability, they were actually irresponsible to their employees, had a chaotic management of the company, operated the company in a deceptive way, and took advantage of various loopholes to achieve the goal of not paying for the workers.

This is a small and developing company with various drone service projects. During this time, I met several interesting experts, studied automatic hangar systems and infrared detection technology, and traveled to a rural area for a while. At the same time, I tested and experimented with an original infrared camera and also returning to night flight tasks.

>**KirisameGroup Library KBM Special Zone - Diary**  
>**2021/11/26 17:19**  
>Now been in Rudong Town, Li County for 3 days. It's much better here than Shenzhen. Although every meal was served in clay pot, the food is really cheap and fresh.  
>The solar panel inspection may still fall into the situation of shielding inferior manufacturers. We will see the result tonight. The weather in the wilderness at night is such cold!  
>
>**2021/11/26 23:23**  
>The EL inspection experiment is completed. It may be difficult to let the supplier escape this process through various technical operations. The defects of the solar panels are still very obvious under different infrared sensitivity

First of all, the quality of the company's projects was not high, and they treated customers inconsistently. These were understandable to me, as most Chinese companies do things in this way.  
But as time went by, I discovered more and more strange phenomena. Not only did they treat expensive drones like Matrice 300 as consumables and crashes everywhere, but many senior employees had no say in the company at all.

Finally, in the last few days, the project they used to deceive customers ran into problems in my hands and was about to be exposed. They forced me to resign for that, and I was very disappointed and angry, but after going through so many ups and downs, I knew what I should do at this time. I went down the street and toke dinner easily and took the subway back to my warm home.

Some time after I left, I was preparing to take action. It happened that an expert in the company contacted me and said that he doubted the company's use of intellectual property, and he was going to have a talk with the boss. So that night, I monitored their conversation in a darkside upstairs. It was really cold outside the high-rise building. Afterwards, we learned that the boss intended to steal the research and development results of the expert. So the expert and I decided to cooperate and take legal measures.

After our subsequent operations, we not only forced the company to compensate for my debts, but also let our customers know the fact of fraud. The expert's matter had such a great impact that their main technical personnel could not bear it and decided to resign and file a lawsuit, some succeeded and some failed. In the end, we still forced the company to got out of the R&D and service industry, which was a great lesson for the boss. Later, the two of us even planned to steal the hangar and drones, but because the expected benefits were not great, we just treated it as a joke.

At that time, I kept thinking back to what my supervisor said:  
>First-class companies set standards, second-class companies make products, and third-class companies provide services.

I warned myself that "Staying at the bottom is really dangerous, and now there's even fourth class showing up.", so I decided to go to a more advanced place, and I decided not to trust these small companies anymore.

In fact, we should not only be careful of those black-handed entrepreneurs driven by profit, but also be careful whether we will be driven by money and deviate from our dreams, morals and development paths.
Money can be stolen or robbed, but time and dreams cannot be compensated. It is really important to ensure everyone's happiness.

In this way, the New Year and spring of 2022, mixed with modeling, mapping, and going shopping and walking in various places, gradually passed. During this period, I also received interview invitations from some companies. Some of them did not accept me because I did not have a pilot license; and some were because of poor treatment then I didn't decide to accept, but we're still willing to exchange some opinions together.

Finally one day at noon, a company contacted me a whole month after I submitted my resume to them. I didn’t have much expectations at first, but because I was surprised, I readily agreed to go for the interview.

> Is this the **more powerful place** you said, Master?

After I got out of the elevator door and saw the empty office that could contain two hundred blocks, that was the first thought in my mind. 

I'm not even sure that this is the rumored to be the strongest remote sensing and aerial imaging department in Shenzhen, and it's also the government's largest contractor.

The department manager asked some simple technical questions, and the interview went very smoothly.

It took me a weekend off to realize just how dramatic things were.

This is the last full-time job I’ve had as of this writing. During that period, I stretched my personal abilities to the limit. I considered countless possibilities and rejected countless ideas. In the end, I even tried so hard to prevent myself from becoming a bad person.

## The capital machine on its last legs

Monday, I got to the office and I asked where's the technical director of the department, and workers said:

>"He is gone, you are his replacement".

In this way, I unexpectedly became the technical director of that mysterious, top-notch department in the industry. I couldn't help but feel that the world is really small (I never even told my master about this experience). Even the previous expert envied me and said: "Wow, you got so many solar panels here. I can borrow your site to test those infrared cameras one day!" (Later he even borrowed our drone).

But I couldn't be that happy. I sat on the table, looking at the total being chilling office and thinking: "Where did all these people go? How can I, a drone operator with no management skills, to grow this place..."

My first task was to get to the suburbs to take a video of a law enforcement scene, which was not a good first impression. Imagine that you are operating a drone flying and recording super accurately in gaps between buildings, but there are villagers fighting with the police next to you.

Soon after, I went on a business trip to Qingdao to deliver a batch of important information. Although it sounds hilarious to send a whole desktop PC to copy the data. But the foods and hotels there are really super comfortable. I think it's comparable to Japan.

So, this workplace is also an full of experience of various emotions.

After I came back, I continued the daily job routine of getting up early and coming back late every day with not much things to do. I slowly learned the various functions of ArcGIS PRO and NX. And discovering old materials, instruments and drone parts in the old piles everywhere in the building, hoping to have some breakthroughs in 3d processing (I even found a lot of toiletries that still usable). With occasionally encounters various urgent or unreasonable air support requests from other departments. Because I have a lot of free time, I have made many enthusiastic colleagues. At least everyday's lunch time are fun because everyone never argee with each other's tastes.

One of my greatest achievements here is that I completed a completely legal and 90% profitable large-scale remote sensing project. I was responsible for the entire process of flight and production by myself without any mistakes, completely replacing the work process that required more than a dozen people in the records. In addition, I processed a large amount of legacy data as required by the department manager and tried to save some broken projects.

However, not only did I not receive any rewards, the group even reduced the salary of our department and tried to disband the department on the grounds of poor business, and deliberately transferred our few remaining team members to a very distant workplace, hoping they would resign on their own. One of my colleagues with a national background, who was very important to me, also used to value the city of Shenzhen very much. He left some words before resigning and returning to the inner land:

>"I finally came to Shenzhen, but this house is a liar... Dong, if you want to be an expert, you must get specialize in a subject and publish some articles..."

He is the most technically and academically powerful colleague in my department, also with a wide range of interests and hobbies. It's more than just an ordinary working relationship. His departure really makes me sad.

When the subsequent dialogue with the company turned ineffective, I took various means of espionage, sabotage and crime to protect my own financial interests and indirectly protested to the group (the records are really inappropriate to be made public).

>**KirisameGroup Library KBM Special Zone - Diary**  
>**2023/09/03 06:37**  
>Writing this, I am thinking, although companies are interest groups, it's obvious that some companies have lost their cohesion, and the loyalty and trust between employers and employees have been lost.  
>It can be compared to say that we have milk, eggs and flour, but everyone is shirking the responsibility of cooking, and either fighting to the death or leaving with hungry.  
>In the end, milk, eggs and flour didn't turn into a cake.  
>However, some people have different ideas, and their ideas are very straightforward:  
>If the kitchen, milk, eggs and flour can be burned down, then there will be no more struggles and disappointments in the place.  

My colleagues also didn't give up and continued to go to their work places and refused to cooperate with the work. I also realized the worst possible outcome, and began to refuse to work, no longer abide by the company's various schedules, began to encrypt my work results and transfer them to a private database. I naturally ignored the department manager's questions about my above behavior because she was also told clearly unable to improve the situation in all aspects.

Later, the company made a ultimatum to me and other colleagues to resign on our own. But I refused to deliver various lists to the company and refused to sign the company's resignation documents. In the end, I received a forced dismissal document. With my PC and all drone-related equipment were been sealed.

At first, I didn't intend to pursue that, because I knew that my goal had been achieved. But because I admired the legal awareness and strong willing of other colleagues, I decided to go unite and sue the company. Some of those workers were even in their first contact with legal proceedings.

So, we found a night, waited for the night shift to go out, and then unlocked the main door and entered openly (thanks to the security personnel who also did not cooperate with the work). They turned on their computers and sorted out various message records. I opened the drawer where the keys were placed, found the key to the safe room, went in and get my PC and drone out, cleaned up all flight documents and logs, then printed a lot of work records, contracts and financial reports. After confirming that everything was reset, we quickly disappeared in the rain. Serval afternoon later, we went to the Labor Bureau and filed the lawsuit.

After the trial and many days of adjudication, I only got a little change of cash in the end, while one of my colleagues received ten thousands of yuan in compensation. We also received message that the company's executives and department managers have also resigned from their job voluntarily.

I think we won, and that colleague received a bunch of money that was a huge sum for an intern to make up for the workplace insult he suffered. And I evened out the financial relationship with the company, took away all the mission results that were beneficial to me, and did not leave any resources worth their use, and ended the legend of this industry, ~~but I still willing to blow up the group's headquarter building with an air raid one day.~~

## Chasing the ideal machine

During that time, I always thought: "Shenzhen the most developed place in the drone industry is reaching its end. There are not many places that can be trusted. Do I still have a chance to see the so-called manned multi-copter aircraft?"

[](Finally have free time to order a maid dress!)

But at least, finally, everything is done. Although there're' sometimes scattered pilot tasks, my health status has gradually recovered and I have regained my interests in clothing and cooking. I have more time to chat and hang out with my former colleagues. I also went to Hong Kong for sightseeing again after the epidemic, but I still feel very uneasy about my economic situation.

One morning, Youtube occasionally recommended @zeekk's homemade eVTOL video to me on the homepage.

I was a little tired at the time, but I found many interesting features in his video and thought it was a good opportunity! So I couldn't wait to send him an email.

(The original text of the following dialogue is all in Chinese)

>KBM:  
> **Hello, about the video of the homemade E-VTOL I saw on OilPipe** *(YouTube)* **...**  
>
>I watched this video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3lqXjbzbp8  
>
>I am a retired and hided person in the drone industry from Shenzhen...You can call me KBM or FISH.  
>Because I found that we have a lot in common in the design concept and equipment selection of multi-rotor aircraft, I have never had such a strong sense of identity, so I really hope to join any project-related Discord group in my personal name. I wonder if there is such an opportunity?  
>Maybe it's also because I am eager to absorb knowledge or provide help...  
>
>Thanks。  
>
>By the way, nice to meet you, I remembered that I had written a very self-willed personal profile on my OSM personal homepage. At that time, I hoped that strangers or people in charge of various industries could understand my basic situation through this channel. Now it should be useful:  
>https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/Mollysuh

About 10 days later, I got his reply, it's needless to say how glad I was:  

>Zeekk:  
>Hey FISH,  
>
>Just read your profile. Some other YouTube friends recommended a few options to me. See if those can help. 
>
>**https://discord.gg/arrow**  
>https://discord.gg/qMMgBk63  
>
>Alan Zhang

So I joined Arrow's server and found it to be quite sophisticated (but a little lacking in organization).


>KBM:  
>Glad to hear the reply from you, Zhang!  
>
>Thanks for the recommendation. This is the first time I have discovered the E-VTOL community, especially the one called Arrow, which is very interesting, although not particularly active. They plan to do open source projects, have been publishing their progress on the server, and have organized a lot of mechanical and electronic reference materials in many categories.  
>When I scrolled forward, I found that they also recommended your video, and they hope you can join too (laughs).
>
>Appreciate again.
>
>Fish Dong

...

In this way, I not only found a place with similar interests. But also in the next two months, I had some custom clothes ordered, participated in various hobby activities, drone exhibitions and some flight instruction work with the expert, which made me regain some vitality.
Although there were lots of ~~electronic garbage~~ at the exhibition, which made me neither laugh and cry out. But also Many exhibitor staffs said that I didn’t look like been working for 7 years at all, which made me feel very happy.

I feel that this is a new beginning, a huge progress for me and an important step towards the world, but language is still my biggest obstacle.

## Conclusion in aircraft words

>"If you feel sad about quitting job, go have a hot pot and cheer yourself up! I wish your next drone can be used for 20 years without crash."

>"I have been thinking about Coach Mai, and I find that I am still a moon away far from being a strong pilot. I also want to see the scenes of using anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft missiles to shoot those drones. He is a very energetic and fun person, but unfortunately he is also getting old."

>"Ehang will definitely try their best to ensure that there won't be any personal casualty with their aircraft, including but not limited to exiting the market."

>“A set of brand new abandoned commercial drone found in a random garage yesterday afternoon.”

（FIN）
